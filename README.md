# Getting Started with Create React App

# installing all module => npm install

# run the application => npm start 

N.B : The application can take some minutes to start beacause of react server 

Accomplished:
    - Search input is disabled until result show.
    - Showing the result filter by country with pagination. 
    - Search user by username after showing the result.
    - The results are sorted by joined (id) : recent to old.
    - The image in the user card is a link to his github profile.


Mistake: 
    - Search : it works at first use when the result appeared but when you delete input , it doesn't give any render , refresh when the bugs occure.
    - I didn't use a Github_token because I use axios.
    - I can only display 100 users per country, I don't know how to display more than that.
